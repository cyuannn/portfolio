                    <h3>Jerry, the Wellness Consultant</h3>
                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>The Wellness Consultant is a Python program designed to provide personalized daily wellness plans. Based on user input regarding weight, age, height, and personal goals, the program generates recommendations for water intake, protein intake, workout routines, and mental and emotional wellness tips.
                    <h5>Why I Created This Program</h5>   
                    <p>As someone who struggled with taking adequate care of myself, my journey with wellness has been long and ongoing. Only recently do I feel as though I've done enough work and research to finally feel physically, mentally, and emotionally decent. Research shows that many people struggle with wellness challenges, so I created this program to try to provide a baseline foundation for where people can start their journeys. My hope is that this program can offer guidance and support for those looking to improve their overall well-being.</p>
                    <h5>Features </h5> 
                    <p>Calculates daily water and protein intake based on user data.</p>
                    <p>Provides personalized workout plans.</p>
                    <p>Offers mental and emotional wellness tips tailored to user goals.</p>
                    <p>Sends daily wellness updates.</p>

                    <h3>Maximillion, the Financial Advisor</h3>
                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>This Java program is designed to help users assess their current financial situation, set short-term and long-term financial goals, and receive personalized recommendations on budgeting, saving, and credit card usage. The program guides users through a series of prompts to input their financial details, including monthly income, expenses, credit card debt, and current savings. Users are also asked to specify their financial goals, such as short-term and long-term savings and debt reduction targets.</p>
                    <h5>Why I Created This Program</h5>   
                    <p>Creating this financial literacy program stems from the recognition that financial literacy is one of the most important yet under-taught subjects in schools. Understanding personal finance is fundamental to achieving a life of freedom and security. Despite its critical importance, many people lack the essential knowledge and tools to manage their finances effectively, leading to debt, financial stress, and missed opportunities for wealth building. Capital One's mission to promote financial literacy and freedom deeply resonates with me. Their commitment to empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources to make informed financial decisions aligns with my own beliefs and goals. This program is my contribution to this mission, aimed at helping people take control of their financial lives.</p>
                    <h5>Features </h5> 
                    <p> Financial assessment from monthly income input, monthly expenses input, credit card debt input, and current savings input</p>
                    <p>Goal setting: short-term savings goal, short-term debt reduction goal, long-term savings goal, long-term debt reduction goal</p>
                    <p>Budgeting: housing, transportation, groceries, discretionary </p>
                    <p>Financial recommendations: monthly savings potential, short-term goal tracking, long-term goal tracking </p>
                    <p>Capital One credit card recommendations: balance transfer cards, cash back cards, travel rewards cards </p>
                    <p>Additional suggestions: expense tracking, HYSA, budget review and adjustment </p>
